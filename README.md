# TIL

> Today I Learned

A collection of concise write-ups on small things I learn day to day across a
variety of languages and technologies. These are things that don't really
warrant a full blog post. These are mostly things I learn working with
smart people at [Drools/JBPM Team](http://www.drools.org/community/team.html).
